# Database Design

The layout of the database in Mongo is designed for organization and visualization of the data needed for the front end:

### Collection 1 - Users

The first collection will hold specific data to user. Each object will hold:
- User Object ID (automatically generated by MongoDB)
- User's Ethereum Address
- User's Ethereum Balance
- Possibly other personal information like usernames, emails, phone numbers, etc (For future use)


### Collection 2 - Transactons

The second collection will hold primarily just transactions and other essential values needed. Eah object will hold:
- Transaction Object ID (automatically generated by MongoDB)
- Transaction Type (Normal, Internal, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)
- Transation Data (Pulled from Etherscan API)

### Collection 3 - User Transactions

The third collection will hold combined data of each user and their transactions. Each object will hold:
- Object ID (automatically generated by MongoDB)
- Date Collected
- User Object ID (Pulled from Collection 1)
- Transaction Object ID (Pulled from Collection 2)
